# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Code for some machine Learning algorithms implemented from scratch for a graduate-level class on ML algorithms:

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
Viterbi Algorithm (Dynamic Programming)
Convolutional Neural Network
ID3 Decision Trees (Utilized Object Oriented Programming)
Q-Learning (Model-Free Reinforcement Learning)
Logistic Regression (For this project, had to do significant data cleaning and processing; data cleaning file is included)

** The datasets are not included due to their large sizes. Only the ML algorithms and test files that I implemented are included.
